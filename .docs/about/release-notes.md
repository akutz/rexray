## Version 0.2.0 (2015-09-30)

### Installation, SysV, SystemD Support
REX-Ray now includes built-in support for installing itself as a service on
Linux distributions that support either SystemV or SystemD initialization
systems. This feature has been tested successfully on both CentOS 7 Minimal
(SystemD) and Ubuntu 14.04 Server (SystemV) distributions.

To install REX-Ray on a supported Linux distribution, all that is required
now is to download the binary and execute:

    sudo ./rexray service install

What does that do? In short the above command will determine if the Linux
distribution uses systemctl, update-rc.d, or chkconfig to manage system
services. After that the following steps occur:

 1. The path /opt/rexray is created and chowned to root:root with permissions
 set to 0755.
 2. The binary is copied to /opt/rexray/rexray and chowned to root:root with
 permissions set to 4755. This is important, because this means that any
 non-privileged user can execute the rexray binary as root without requiring
 sudo privileges. For more information on this feature, please read about the
 [Linux kernel's super-user ID (SUID) bit](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Security-HOWTO/file-security.html).

 Because the REX-Ray binary can now be executed with root privileges by
 non-root users, the binary can be used by non-root users to easily attach
 and mount external storage.

 3. The directory /etc/rexray is created and chowned to root:root.

The next steps depends on the type of Linux distribution. However, it's
important to know that the new version of the REX-Ray binary now supports
managing its own PID (at `/var/run/rexray.pid`) when run as a service as well
as supports the standard SysV control commands such as `start`, `stop`,
`status`, and `restart`.

For SysV Linux distributions that use `chkconfig` or `update-rc.d`, a symlink
of the REX-Ray binary is created in `/etc/init.d` and then either
`chkconfig rexray on` or `update-rc.d rexray defaults` is executed.

Modern Linux distributions have moved to SystemD for controlling services.
If the `systemctl` command is detected when installing REX-Ray then a unit
file is written to `/etc/systemd/system/rexray.servic`e with the following
contents:

    [Unit]
    Description=rexray
    Before=docker.service

    [Service]
    EnvironmentFile=/etc/rexray/rexray.env
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rexray start -f
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
    KillMode=process

    [Install]
    WantedBy=docker.service

The REX-Ray service is not started immediately upon installation. The install
command completes by informing the users that they should visit the
[REX-Ray website](http://github.com/emccode/rexray) for information on how to
configure REX-Ray's storage drivers. The text to the users also explains how
to start the REX-Ray service once it's configured using the service command
particular to the Linux distribution.

### Single Service
This release also removes the need for REX-Ray to be configured as multiple
service instances in order to provide multiple end-points to such consumers
such as `Docker`. REX-Ray's backend now supports an internal, modular design
which enables it to host multiple module instances of any module, such as the
DockerVolumeDriverModule. In fact, one of the default, included modules is...

### Admin Module & HTTP JSON API
The AdminModule enables an HTTP JSON API for managing REX-Ray's module system
as well as provides a UI to view the currently running modules. Simply start
the REX-Ray server and then visit the URL http://localhost:7979 in your favorite
browser to see what's loaded. Or you can access either of the currently
supported REST URLs:

    http://localhost:7979/r/module/types

and

    http://localhost:7979/r/module/instances

Actually, those aren't the *only* two URLs, but the others are for internal
users as of this point. However, the source *is* open, so... :)

If you want to know what modules are available by using the CLI, after starting
the REX-Ray service simply type:

    [0]akutz@poppy:rexray$ rexray service module types
    [
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "DockerVolumeDriverModule",
        "addresses": [
          "unix:///run/docker/plugins/rexray.sock",
          "tcp://:7980"
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "AdminModule",
        "addresses": [
          "tcp://:7979"
        ]
      }
    ]
    [0]akutz@poppy:rexray$

To get a list of the *running* modules you would type:

    [0]akutz@poppy:rexray$ rexray service module instance get
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "typeId": 1,
        "name": "AdminModule",
        "address": "tcp://:7979",
        "description": "The REX-Ray admin module",
        "started": true
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "typeId": 2,
        "name": "DockerVolumeDriverModule",
        "address": "unix:///run/docker/plugins/rexray.sock",
        "description": "The REX-Ray Docker VolumeDriver module",
        "started": true
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "typeId": 2,
        "name": "DockerVolumeDriverModule",
        "address": "tcp://:7980",
        "description": "The REX-Ray Docker VolumeDriver module",
        "started": true
      }
    ]
    [0]akutz@poppy:rexray$

Hmmm, you know, the REX-Ray CLI looks a little different in the above examples,
doesn't it? About that...

### Command Line Interface
The CLI has also been enhanced to present a more simplified view up front to
users. The commands are now categorized into logical groups:

    [0]akutz@pax:~$ rexray
    REX-Ray:
      A guest-based storage introspection tool that enables local
      visibility and management from cloud and storage platforms.

    Usage:
      rexray [flags]
      rexray [command]

    Available Commands:
      volume      The volume manager
      snapshot    The snapshot manager
      device      The device manager
      adapter     The adapter manager
      service     The service controller
      version     Print the version
      help        Help about any command

    Global Flags:
      -c, --config="/Users/akutz/.rexray/config.yaml": The REX-Ray configuration file
      -?, --help[=false]: Help for rexray
      -h, --rexrayHost="tcp://:7979": The REX-Ray service address

      -v, --verbose[=false]: Print verbose help information

    Use "rexray [command] --help" for more information about a command.

### Travis-CI Support
REX-Ray now supports Travis-CI builds either from the primary REX-Ray repository
or via a fork. All builds should be executed through the Makefile, which is a
Travis-CI default. For the Travis-CI settings please be sure to set the
environment variable `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` to `1`.
